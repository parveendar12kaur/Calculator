# Tesla Particles

---

> Enabling Engineer Efficiencies, one project at a time.

Particles is Tesla's Design System and shared Component Library.

## What's it good for?
Particles is the foundation of the Tesla Design and Component System (TDCS). If you are building a website and would like to adhere to the TDCS, follow these instructions.

## Who uses it?
The Tesla Web team, Options Code Warehouse team, and other supporting teams.

## Design System… what's that?
A method of approaching visual and component design that establishes consistent patterns.

# Workflow

## Introduction

Every application should begin with Particles as the foundation. As an Engineer, there is a lot that is provided to you just out-of-the-box with Particles that would likely take several weeks to create yourself.

As applications are being built out, there will likely be adjustments necessary to the foundation of the application. Particles accomodates for this is that you can adjust the values of the default variables ([colors](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/colors.html), [locales](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/variables.html), [sizes](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/variables_for_sizing.html), and [more](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/variables.html)). The benefit here, is that _everyone_ across _all tech stacks_ that use Particles as their foundation need only to know the variable names, and they're already proficient in building the front-end of the application.

## Building for Compliancy and Reuse

As Particles is an tech-stack-agnostic Design System, meant to be applied to any tech stack (React, PHP, .NET, Node, Angular, AEM, etc), new components must be thoroughly tested for compliancy and cross-browser compatibility. If there's any Javascript necessary for the component it must also be written in a pure-javascript fashion so as not to make any assumptions on where the component may be used nor the tech-stack available (i.e. we should not assume jQuery, etc is available as it may not be).

## Installation

### Install Particles from Internal Registry

Particles is currently only available internally, so you'll to specify the registry where Particles is located. You can do this in the following one-line command:

```shell
$> npm install @tesla/particles --registry https://npmregistry.teslamotors.com
```

### Import Particles base to your Project

Now that you've got Particles installed to your project, you'll need to add the base Sass file to your project's Sass file.

````scss
@import "[../path/to]/node_modules/@tesla/particles/scss/base";
````

You're now off to the races with the default styles for Particles.

## Other helpful `@imports`

These are not included in the `base.scss` file because it is not core to the User Experience for Particles. If you want to use them on your site, you'll need to include the imports referenced below

### Reset

Particles comes with a reset as well; simply add it above the reference to Particles' base Sass file:

```scss
@import "[../path/to]/node_modules/@tesla/particles/scss/reset";
```

### Asset Modal

```scss
@import "[../path/to]/node_modules/@tesla/particles/scss/_particles/extras/asset-modal";
```

### Icons

```scss
@import "[../path/to]/node_modules/@tesla/particles/scss/_particles/extras/icons";
```

### Loading Widget

```scss
@import "[../path/to]/node_modules/@tesla/particles/scss/_particles/extras/loading-widget";
```

### Vehicle Badges

```scss
@import "[../path/to]/node_modules/@tesla/particles/scss/_particles/extras/vehicle-badges";
```

## Sweet, what markup do I use?

This is a great question! In order to see the markup, there are two ways:

1. View [http://particles.tesla.com/styleguide](http://particles.tesla.com/styleguide). Most all the styling listed in the base install of Particles has been documented here, as well as some of the `extras`.
2. `clone` the Particles repo, and run the `gulp` command in the root of the directory. This will require gulp and Hologram to work.
   1. if you clone it, then you can contribute back to it… :) *hint hint*

### Contributing to Tesla Particles

1. DOCUMENTATION
- Make a ticket in the AWSM project in Jira.

2. FIRST TIME BUILDING
- Clone down project
- run `npm install`
- run `gem install hologram`
- run `gulp`

3. BRANCHES, PRS, & PROCESS
- Checkout a new branch from master or the latest release branch with the name of your ticket in the branch name.
- Make your updates to the scss files, updating documentation if necessary. Build the project to make sure your changes are working as intended.
- LINT YO CHANGES. Make sure your changes don't add any linter errors or warnings. Check "how to lint" for instructions.
- Commit your changes AND the built files with the ticket name, and push up your branch.
- Open a PR into the branch that matches the fixVersion in the Jira ticket.

## How to lint

All contributions to Particles should go through the linter.
Install sass-lint globally if you haven't already with `npm install -g sass-lint`
Then run this command in the project.
```
› sass-lint -c .sass-lint.yml --no-exit -v
```
Output lives in ./linters/sass-lint.html which you can open in a browser.
