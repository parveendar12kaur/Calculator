# Particles v2.7.4

> Enabling engineer efficiencies, one project at a time.

There are as many bug fixes in this release as there are feature requests or improvements to existing features.

TL;DR. https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide (click the hamburger menu to see all the documentation)
* [Country Flags](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/icons_-_country_flags.html)
* [Hero Component](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/layout_-_page_header.html)
* [Flexbox Grid System](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/layout_-_flexbox_grid.html)
* [Background Scrims](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/helpers.html#02_helperslist)

**NOTE** While this is not labeled as a breaking change, there are a couple improvements to existing features. It would be wise to do a smoke test once installing.

As more and more teams start using Particles (active usage is well over 25+ applications from all over the company!), the more critical it is that the bug count stay low for Particles (both in documentation, and the components used across applications). As such, several bugs relating specifically to the Particles website have been resolved, easing consumption and promoting Particles as a robust system from which Engineers can build their applications from.

If you see or hear of any bugs, please report them either in the [~Tesla Particles](https://teamchat.tesla.com/tesla/channels/tesla-particles) Mattermost channel, by logging a bug in the [Particles Jira project](https://issues.teslamotors.com/projects/AWSM), or by [emailing me directly](mailto:eritchey@tesla.com).

## What's on the roadmap?
* `v2.8.0` will be focusing on a more modular design which will enable a more componentized approach to system architecture. This paves the way for Particles to start building out Web Components, in addition to allowing consuming projects to move forward even faster in their desired architecture. The Future is here, and it's looking really great.
* `v3.0.0` is also on the horizon, and it's going to be a big release, coming with it a complete redesign structurally and to the UI. This work will really transform Particles into a well-known and robust system, fit for use in so many contexts

## What’s New?

Particles is one arm of the Tesla Design System. This is still being fleshed out, but more in the coming months.

## New features

### New Country Flags
Particles now includes Country Flags as both base64 encoded files (less performant, but much more portable) and the actual SVG assets (less portable, but more performant). Additionally, each flag is in it’s own Sass Partial, making it even to use a single flag without incurring the bandwidth of the full flag suite. Americas, Asia Pacific, European, and Middle Eastern regions are also built as standalone Sass Partials. [AWSM-126](https://issues.teslamotors.com/browse/AWSM-126)

### Hero Component

Included here is the functionality to have a hero carousel, a static hero, and a hero with title and/or subnav links. There is a single “alternate” state which should be used when using hero and/or subnav on darker hero images. [AWSM-114](https://issues.teslamotors.com/browse/AWSM-114)

### Flexbox Grid System

A basic yet fully functional grid system based in Flexbox, a somewhat new CSS technology that has very wide support in all major browsers. Using this more fully will allow us to remove a dependency on a third party tool to create our grid system. Flexgrid (as I have started calling it) is already in use in several new components on the New Website Squad for tesla.com. [AWSM-38](https://issues.teslamotors.com/browse/AWSM-38)

### Background Scrims

Implemented an easy-to-use system of inserting a background color to your page or section of a page. [AWSM-141](https://issues.teslamotors.com/browse/AWSM-141)

## Improvements

### Sidescroll Header consumable by New Header Component

Sidescroll header component can now be consumed by a Hero Component, which is built on the same basic foundation as Sidescroll. If you have implemented Sidescroll in an application, there are a couple markup changes you’ll need to make. [AWSM-119](https://issues.teslamotors.com/browse/AWSM-119)

## Bugfixes

Several long-standing bug fixes have been resolved in this release of Particles. Line-heights of buttons and anchor tags now match, button sizing fixed, Firefox overflow issue when viewed in a mobile viewport, and the error message area for select boxes is now visible.

## Documentation updates

In addition to the bugfixes to Particles itself, the documentation of Particles has gotten easier to consume.

# Particles v2.7.1 released!

> Enabling Engineer efficiencies, one project at a time.

Hey all!

Hot on the heels of v2.7.0 we are releasing v2.7.1, which contains several enhancements and a couple bug fixes.

Here's the tl;dr list:
* [Account / Authentication UI for v3.0 header](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/header.html#02_headeraccountlinks)
* [Tooltips](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/tooltip.html)
* [Common Footer](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/footer.html)
* [Updates to documentation typography](https://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/)
* Couple documentation bugfixes [AWSM-82](https://issues.teslamotors.com/browse/AWSM-82) and [AWSM-77](https://issues.teslamotors.com/browse/AWSM-82)

## Account / Authentication UI for v3.0 header
Previous iterations of our header buried the login portion of tesla.com deep in the menu structure (especially on mobile). This enhancement now makes the Login and Account section of the website more of a first-class citizen. This is a major enhancement for the Dashboard experience and team. h/t to @sbuckle and @jonlane for leading this effort

_This is simply a Phase 1.0 of the Account UI. Stay tuned for more_

## Tooltips
The Energy team is implementing the idea of tooltips and is porting all of this effort to Particles. In fact, this is one of the first contributed pieces to _start_ in Particles, and then be pushed downstream to consuming applications. h/t to @rlabancz for your contributions here.

## Common footer
How long have we been wanting this? Yea, long time. We now have a common UI pattern for our skinny footer element (those that work on tesla.com know what i am referring to here with skinny footer). h/t to @sbrahmi for contributing a bug fix to @eritchey's code

_There is more to come here. Like a locale selector modal, locale flags, etc._

## Particles Documentation updates
While this is an ongoing effort until the day we close up shop (which is hopefully _never_), the typographic heirarchy of the styleguide needed some help. h/t to @btamayo for pushing me to update this

# What should I be interested in?

## Join the Discussion
Come hang out with us all in [~Tesla Particles](https://teamchat.tesla.com/tesla/channels/tesla-particles) or [~Guild - Design Systems]() on Mattermost. We'd love to hear from you!!

## Particles is expanding!
Interest in Particles is growing. Seems like having a Design System is an interesting topic to so many of you :)  Contributions, feature requests, and improvements are coming from all over. This is very exciting!

Thing is — there are some growing pains. For one, the repositories connected to [Particles have found a new home](https://stash.teslamotors.com/projects/PARTICLES/). There you'll find the following projects:

### [Particles Core](https://stash.teslamotors.com/projects/PARTICLES/repos/particles-core/browse)
This is the crux of the whole system. The tech-agnostic stack of UI patterns and components.

### [Particles Core Assets](https://stash.teslamotors.com/projects/PARTICLES/repos/particles-core-assets/browse)
@tfisher - one of our fabulous interns - wanted to learn Sketch and so he used Particles Core as a foundation from which to learn the tool. He has done a fabulous job of creating a first round of things that are included in Particles (as well as some that are not but found elsewhere on Tesla.com). The documents within this repo will evolve over time to be more comprehensive, but at least we have a start!

### [Particles Core Starterkit](https://stash.teslamotors.com/projects/PARTICLES/repos/particles-core-starterkit/browse)
New to Particles and want to learn more? This repo is for you. Simply clone it, and follow the directions located within.

### [React Particles](https://stash.teslamotors.com/projects/PARTICLES/repos/react-particles/browse)
React Particles is design around the idea of making life easier for React Engineers who want to use Particles but don't want to be bothered with understanding it :) . This is the same repo as before, just combining all the Particles things together in one central place. If you would like more (actual) information on React Particles, please do not hesitate to ask in either [~Tesla Particles](https://teamchat.tesla.com/tesla/channels/tesla-particles) or the [~ReactJS](https://teamchat.tesla.com/tesla/channels/react-js) channels. @jegan, @rcheung, @tpae, or @eritchey can point you in the right direction!

### [Particles Emails](https://stash.teslamotors.com/projects/PARTICLES/repos/particles-emails/browse)
Turns out, writing these release emails in Markdown then copying them over to Outlook is not too pretty. @rlabancz is a champ and volunteered to help create an email template that follows closely to the email templates he is already creating for the Energy and Model 3 Teams. Major h/t to you!

### [Angular Particles](https://stash.teslamotors.com/projects/PARTICLES/repos/angular-particles/browse)
@edlee is working toward an integration with Particles on the Angular side of things, similar to React Particles. The first component to be created I believe will be the new v3.0 Header. Stay tuned for more information on this.

## Codebase Quality Improvements
While the codebase is pretty clean as of the 2.7.0 release, there is still a lot of manual labor put into this. Incoming changes are Sass Lint and CSSComb as pre-commit hooks.

## Systems Documentation Improvements
Never. Ending. Documentation.

## Improving the improvements!

# Particles v2.6.0
This release of Particles focuses on the documentation of what’s actually in Particles, making it more valuable to Product, Design, and Engineering. As it has always been, Particles' overarching vision has been "Enabling Efficiencies", and this brings us one step closer. There’s still a lot of work to do around this, but this is a step in the right direction.

In addition to the boost in documentation, we also have some new features and some big fixing.

*NOTE: This release should be considered a **breaking change**.  If you have used any of the icons in Particles 2.5.x or lower, please look over the release notes carefully*

Enough intro… onward.

## What’s new?
### [Vehicle](http://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/icons_for_vehicles.html) and [General](http://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/icons_for_general_use.html) icons, now with more crisp
Jennifer Lee and I worked together to standardize and optimize our icons. These new icons are crisper and even more scalable than before.

In addition to several new icons, all of our old icons have been properly namespaced to Particles. This is a *breaking change* to existing icons in use in previous versions.

Vehicle icons have also been added to Particles. Items like Steering wheels, car doors, shocks, etc have all been added. These new icons are helping the FMT team in meeting their deadline as well as allowing other engineers using Particles in their applications to have access to a richer set of icons.

Check out our [general icons](http://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/icons_for_general_use.html) or the [vehicle icons](http://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/icons_for_vehicles.html) on Particles.

### “[T-Shirt](http://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/icon_sizes.html)” Size variables
Setting up several sass variables gives engineers the ability to create consistent, appropriately-sized elements across the application. No more guessing-and-checking.

### [Favicon Assets](http://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/assets.html)
Our favicon assets are now included in Particles for your use. You simply need to copy/paste them from Particles into the appropriate location in your application.

### [Tab component](http://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/tabs.html)
Terence Pae needed a tabbed interface for usage in his application. I suggested he make a PR to Particles so this could be used by whoever else might need a tabbed interface.  Thanks, Terence!

### Updated [media query](http://particles.tesla.com/styleguide/layout.html) variables
Our current stack of media query variables is a bit outdated compared to the current browser landscape of mobile, tablet, desktop viewports. While we still have our legacy variables of `$mobile-only`, `$small-desktop-only`, `$small-desktop`, and `$large-desktop`, we have added 3 new variables that will allow finer grain control over the UI.

### All Particles variables are now `!default` by default
Making this change allows engineers to have a good base to work from, retaining the same variables, but override them as necessary for their application. There is nothing here that breaks previous functionality.

## What’s been documented?
### More name spacing
Every new component added will be properly name-spaced with `tsla-` to prevent naming collisions across applications.

### General and Vehicle Icons
Not only were new icons added, but a new mechanism has been included for easy viewing of the assets  and copying the name to the user’s clipboard. This new “asset viewer” UI is also used for the color palette variables and other assets.

Never before was the color palette for a Tesla application stack been published in an easily consumable fashion.

## What’s been fixed?
In addition to the new features and more robust documentation, several bug fixes have been made in this release.
* Layout breaks at exactly 640px
* Missing background image for icon-magnify
* Moving header JS into a window.onload() function
* Button Documentation was deleted in `v2.5.x` unintentionally. Readded and laid out better.

## What’s coming up? (v2.7.0)
* v3.0 tesla.com header
* Documenting grid framework
* More documentation
* … and more!

If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:eritchey@tesla.com), or [create issues](https://issues.teslamotors.com/projects/AWSM).
