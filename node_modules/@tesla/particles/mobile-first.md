# Browser Landscape in 2017

The browser landscape has changed such that we can start building from a "mobile first" perspective. The benefit here is we change our thinking like so:
> "base styling should be desktop-based and we add styling when things need to be different for mobile"

to

> "base styling should be mobile-based and we add styling when things need to be different for desktop"

## But what's the big deal?
Well, it's the inverse of the problem noted above. Since mobile browsers tend to be less-capable than their desktop counterparts, we want to provide them with the least amount of CSS they need to get the job done. Conversely, since desktop browser tend to be more powerful, they can handle getting more styles and more rerenders/reflows.

An example of the above:

### Sass
```
.event-static-map {
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  @include susy-breakpoint($small-desktop) {
    width: 250px;
    height: 150px;
  }
}
```

### Final CSS
```
.event-static-map {
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}
@media (min-width: 640px) {
    .event-static-map {
      width: 250px;
      height: 150px;
    }
}
```

As you can see from the final rendered CSS, this is much slimmer than a "desktop-first" approach like we have been doing historically (shown below):


### Sass:
```
.event-static-map {
    width: 250px;
    height: 150px;
    @include susy-breakpoint($mobile-only) {
        @include base-mobile-reset;
        margin-bottom: 10px;
        height: auto;
    }
}
```

### Final CSS
```
.event-static-map {
    width: 250px;
    height: 150px;
    @media (max-width: 640px) and (min-width: 0) {
        width: 100%;
        clear: both;
        float: none;
        display: block;
        margin-right: auto;
        margin-left: auto;
        margin-bottom: 10px;
        height: auto;
    }
}
```

With are fewer lines of rendered CSS, you are giving mobile / underpowered browsers a better chance at being performant renderers of our content and styling.
