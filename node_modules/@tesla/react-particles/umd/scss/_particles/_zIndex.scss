Want to contribute to tesla-particles?  This page is for you

Problem: We are making particles the home HTML/CSS styles and layout for Tesla Motors. Particles powers many different applications including teslamotors.com, our in-store kiosks and various internal business applications. Because of this expansive re-use, it's important that our re-usable components are compatible with each other, so they can easily be shared as drop-ins without the need for code tweaks.

Solution: Therefore to help you with that we present a bunch of tools that will help us to preserve the harmony between elements, this will make easy to check into other developers parameters and easy to modify if need it.

title: Z Index Map
name: zIndex
categories: SassTools
---
The Z Index Map helps make sure shared components lie at the proper level of an application.

This is the zIndex map, you can find it in `/scss/_particles/_zIndex.scss`

If you are working with z-index you may want to add the main zIndex of your element inside the map and work with differences over it:

```sass_example
$zIndex: (
  sidebar	: 0,
  header    : 1,
  myElement : 10
);

```

You can use this map with `map-get`. The zIndex isn't at the core of particles, so you have to `@import` at the top of your code:

```sass_example
@import '../zIndex';
.header {
  z-index: map-get($zIndex, sidebar);
}
```
*/

$zIndex: (
  sidebar: 0,
  header: 1
);
