# React Components for Particles

Usage
--------

To ensure the associated styles are included for your application integrating `react-particles` there are two techniques:

#### Import `react-particles.css` from `node_modules/@tesla/react-particles`.

```css
@import '~@tesla/react-particles/react-particles'
```


#### Setup Webpack's Extract Text Plugin and CSS Optimizer Plugin so that all implicit imports will be bundled for your application

```javascript
{
  ...,
  plugins: [
    new ExtractTextPlugin({
        filename: './[name].css',
    }),
    new OptimizeCssAssetsPlugin({
        cssProcessorOptions: {
            discardComments: { removeAllButFirst: true }
        }
    }),
    ...
  ],
  ...
}

```
