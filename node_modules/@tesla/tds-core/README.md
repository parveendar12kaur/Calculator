# Tesla Design System

The Tesla Design System is the foundation of all applications built within Tesla, Inc.

## Pattern

TDS will be built based on individual files, which will in turn make consumption and implementation of only certain parts of the system easier.

##Particles + TDS?

For the most part, Particles and TDS will live together in harmony. There are instances where this is not the case. Since this should be a temporary situation, there needs to be a bit of a "translation layer" from Particles to TDS. If you find yourself in this position, you'll want to follow this process:

  1. Install Particles
  2. Install TDS' [`base.css`](https://stash.teslamotors.com/projects/PARTICLES/repos/tds-core/browse/src/assets/css/_tds/base.css)
  3. Install TDS' [`tsla-particles-overrides.css`](https://stash.teslamotors.com/projects/PARTICLES/repos/tds-core/browse/src/assets/css/_tds/tsla-particles-overrides.css)
  4. Write your site's custom code

## Requirements

* **[PostCSS](http://postcss.org/)** - Convert modern (and future) CSS to today's syntax.
* **[cssnext](http://cssnext.io/)** - Use modern (and future) CSS syntax today.

## File Structure

* `reset`
* `typography`
* `buttons`
* `form-elements`
* `tables`
* `progress bar`
* **Icons**
  * `general`
  * `social`
  * `vehicle`
  * `energy`
  * `vehicle badges`
  * `country flags`
  * `loading indicator`
* **Variables / Custom Properties**
  * `sizing`
  * `colors`
  * `locales`
* **Components**
  * `modals`
  * `marketing carousels`
  * `scrims`
  * `site-header`
  * `site-footer`
  * `page-header`/`page-hero`
  * `alerts`
  * `tabs`
  * `card`
  * `flexgrid`
  * `cssgrid`

## Contributing

Like what you see and want to contribute?

```bash
git clone ssh://git@stash.teslamotors.com:7999/particles/tds-core.git
cd tds-core
npm i
gulp
```

## Installation

You can install TDS from Tesla's internal [NPM registry](https://npm.teslamotors.com/package/@tesla/tds-core).

### Fair Warning

Tesla Design System is still currently an in Alpha development. There will be changes, and you may need to incorporate those changes into your squad's time.

If you are interested in the latest "stable" release run the following command:

```bash
[npm|yarn] install @tesla/tds-core@[version] (i.e. 0.6.0-alpha01)
```

Alternatively, if you want bleeding edge, you can install TDS by updating your package.json file with the following dependency:

```bash
"@tesla/tds-core": "git+ssh://git@stash.teslamotors.com:7999/particles/tds-core.git"
```
