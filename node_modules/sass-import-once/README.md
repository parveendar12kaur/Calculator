# Sass Import Once

  When included in a Sass module, sass-import-once will prevent the styles being duplicated if `@import` is called somewhere else. This is cool because it allows every Sass file to declare its own dependencies. This promotes encapulation and allows modules to standalone if need be.

## Installation

```
$ component install wilsonpage/sass-import-once
```

```
$ bower install sass-import-once
```

OR

Just copy the .scss file somewhere into your project.
